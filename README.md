# Enterprise Placement Approach
#Overview
Enterprise Placement Approach is a structured methodology designed to evaluate available land plots for industrial development, specifically targeting priority sectors for St. Petersburg like automotive, pharmacy, and shipbuilding. The framework helps identify and rank potential sites by assessing critical factors such as infrastructure, accessibility, workforce availability, and environmental constraints.
This project aims to support government bodies, industrial planners, and private investors in making informed decisions for the strategic placement of industries.

#Key Features
Sector-Specific Evaluation: Tailored criteria for automotive, pharmaceutical, and shipbuilding industries.
Data-Driven Analysis: Standardized templates and evaluation methods for consistent land assessment.
Strategic Planning Support: Helps prioritize plots based on sector-specific requirements and regional advantages.

#Methodology
The method involves:
1. Identification of Plots: Collect data about available land areas suitable for development.
2. Evaluation Criteria:
- Access to transportation (road, rail, port)
- Proximity to supply chains and markets
- Availability of utilities (electricity, water, waste management)
- Workforce accessibility
- Environmental and zoning regulations
3. Sector Adaptation: Adjust evaluation weights depending on the specific industrial sector.

Each folder in the repository corresponds to a particular sector, providing customized scoring models and assessment guidelines.
